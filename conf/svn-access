# Please see Path-Based Authorization in the Subversion documentation.
#
# Groups can be defined with users and used with @. Aliases can be defined and referred to with &.
# Directories or by all means files are referred to as:
#
# [RepositoryName:/path/to/file/or/directory]
#
# Permissions can be blank (none), r (read) or rw (read and write). Use ~ for negation, for example:
#
# @admins = rw
# ~@admins = r
#
# The pre-defined tokens $authenticated and $anonymous can also be used.
#
# Example:
#
# [groups]
# admins = admin
# example_users = example_user
#
# [ExampleRepo:/]
# @example_users = rw
#
# Default rule below grants full read/write access to all authenticated users.
[/]
$authenticated = rw
